1. **Reset to the desired commit:** Run `git reset --hard c72a09d53d7ca5ff94e4655bedaaa77c6cd8e87b` again to ensure you're at the correct commit.

2. **Clean untracked files:** Run `git clean -df` to remove any untracked files and directories in your working directory. Be careful with this command, as it will permanently delete untracked files and directories.
